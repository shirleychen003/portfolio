        <h3 class = "section_header"> 1. Overview </h3>
        <p> Have you ever had issues managing a subscription, forgotten about a free trial that you signed 
            for, or gone through a tedious process attempting to cancel a service? Subscription services
             are supposed to be considered tools to facilitate everyday tasks, so why can so many problems 
             arise within the subscriptions framework? Subscriptions Super Simplified (3S) was created with
              the objective to solve the aforementioned issues along with <strong>facilitating any processes</strong> while 
              interacting with a subscription service. By using this app, users are able to oversee their
              subscriptions with ease and eliminate any <strong>unnecessary stresses</strong>. </p>
        <p> This app was created as a group project for Professor Olivier St. Cyr’s class <strong>INF352:
            Information Design Studio II: How to Design</strong> at the University of Toronto - St. George.</p>

        <h3 class = "section_header">  2. Research </h3>
        <p> To deepen our understanding of the issues we were trying to address, my group and I conducted
            thorough research using both secondary and primary research methods. </p>

        <p> Prior to conducting the primary research, we explored secondary sources such as news articles,
            current market statistics and reports, and scientific working papers to get an overview of 
            the subject matter. The secondary research topics consisted of services and impact on 
            subscriptions, existing public opinions and solutions, and current business models.
            Once we had a sufficient amount of foundational knowledge, we began to organize and send 
            out primary research methods, which consisted of <strong> a survey through Google forms and individual
            in person interviews.</strong></p>

        <p> By the end of the research process, we had collected 77 anonymous responses in the Google forms,
            and interviewed answers from 16 different individuals. The Google forms link had been posted
            on our Instagram stories, so anyone who had access to the link within the 24 hours before it 
            expired was able to record their response. Our target demographic was subscription users, thus
            for the intersiews, we had two main requirements for the interviewees: they must have at least 
            one subscription and pay for it, and they must have cancelled or tried to cancel at least one service 
            in the past year. These interviews were conducted in person or over the phone. From our research,
             we were able to compile various struggles users had with their subscriptions and then 
            pinpoint the similarities. </p>
            
            <p class = "exclamation"> <strong>75% of the Google forms participants </strong> had at least
                forgotten to cancel their subscription once and <strong>73% </strong>relied on their 
                memory to track their subscriptions.</p>
        <p> Using Miro, we created an affinity map where organized all of our interview data into sections to identify key themes.</p>
        <img src="../projects/SSS pics/affinitymap.png" alt="Affinity Map">
        <p>Along with the issue of forgetting to cancel their subscriptions after a free 
            trial due to lack of tracking methods, the interviewees expressed that 
            there is often a complicated and frustrating cancellation process involved 
            with subscription services. After all our research was gathered and examined,
             we were ready to move onto the ideation process of the project.</p>

    <div class = "ideation">
        <h3 class = "section_header">  3. Ideation </h3>
        <div class = "persona">
        <img src="../projects/SSS pics/selenapic.png" alt="Selena The Subscriber"> </img>
        <p>  An essential part in our project was the ideation process, in which my group and I were able
             to practice collaboration and exercise our creative thinking. </p>

        <p> Part 1 of the ideation process included producing a persona, an empathy map,
             As-Is scenario, and need statements. Firstly, we generated a persona using 
             data from our research and designed a potential scenario that would benefit 
             from using our app. Our persona was Selena the Subscriber, a busy university 
             student with lots of subscriptions. </p>

         </div>

        <p> To gain a deeper understanding of Selena’s <strong>thoughts, motivations, and feelings</strong>,
            we curated an empathy map. Actual quotes and expressed feelings were derived
             from our research data. Using the empathy map, we created an As-Is scenario 
             to walk through a potential real world scenario that Selena would experience 
             when facing an issue with a subscription. The mapped out As-Is scenario 
             clearly communicated the main pain points that Selena had.</p>
